function cov_hist = compute_cov_historical(excessReturns)
% Computes the historical variance-covariance matrix
% Input:
%   - excessReturns: (T x N) matrix of excess stock returns
% Output:
%   - cov_hist: (N x N) annualized historical variance-covariance matrix

    cov_hist = cov(excessReturns);     % daily cov matrix
    cov_hist = cov_hist * 252;         % annualize
